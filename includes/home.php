            <p>My name is James Little, I am currently 23 years old and a student at Texas Tech Universtiy. I am studying Computer Science and hope to one day achieve a doctorate degree in the field of Computer Science. This website contains some recent project I have done for fun or for learning. Not only do I have a passion for programming, but all aspects of computing. I discoverd this love of computers when I was 15 years old and decided to take down the challenge of building my own computer. After weeks of researching and saving, I was able to build my computer. I haven't stop learning and exploring all areas of computing to better my understanding of these machines, to better understand myself.</p>
